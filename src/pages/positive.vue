                   <h1 class="h1">Advantages of the Shinkansen</h1>
                   <p class="p">The construction of the Shinkansen in Japan led to a certain degree to the development of the Japanese economy in the mid to late Showa period and also in the post-war period, and in terms of positive effects, we can distinguish two aspects. In the 1890s, after the railway had opened, it took 18 hours to travel from Tokyo to Osaka, and the cost of travel was equivalent to one month's income per person at the time. Nowadays, with the Shinkansen, it takes only two hours and the cost of travel is only one day per person. By using the Shinkansen today, the "time distance" has been reduced to one ninth and the "economic distance" to about one twenty-fifth compared to the old trains of the 1890s.</p>
                   <h2 class="h2">[1]</h2>
                   <p class="p"> The Shinkansen currently accounts for about 30% of Japan's railway traffic, while its revenue accounts for 45%. The ratio of revenue to expenses for its two representative lines, the Tokaido Shinkansen and the Sanyo Shinkansen, is 100:42 and 100:66 respectively, showing excellent profitability and making it one of the few profitable high-speed railways in the world.</p>
                   <h2 class="h2">[2]</h2>
                   <p class="p"> Secondly, in terms of indirect effects, in 1975, the areas with a high rate of "one-day exchange potential" were confined to the major cities and their surrounding areas. The national average was only 42.5%, rising to 49.1% in 1985 and further to 60.5% in 1998.</p>
                   <h2 class="h2">[3]</h2>
                   <p class="p"> The construction of the Shinkansen constitutes a huge network for the interaction of people within Japan, which not only drives the development of industries related to civil engineering, construction, raw materials and machinery manufacturing, but also promotes the movement of people, accelerates and expands the dissemination of information, knowledge and technology, thus stimulating local economic development and narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas. The Tokaido Shinkansen and the Sanyo Shinkansen, for example, carry 200 million passengers a year, generating consumer spending of around 5 trillion yen on accommodation and tourism alone and increasing employment by 500,000 people. The Tohoku Shinkansen, which opened in 1982, for example, has seen a 45% increase in businesses and a 30% increase in population since its opening, far outstripping the rest of Japan (15% increase in businesses and 10% increase in population in other regions). Similarly, the opening of the Sanyo Shinkansen in 1975 led to rapid changes in the industrial layout along the line, with processing industries such as automobiles, electromechanics, household appliances and cutting-edge industries such as integrated circuits gradually replacing traditional industries such as steel and petrochemicals, contributing to the restructuring of Japan's industries. The construction of the Shinkansen will naturally increase the popularity and attractiveness of the area, making it easier for companies to invest and set up factories, and increasing the number of people living in the area, to name but a few examples. The formation of a high-speed transportation system, mainly the Shinkansen, has contributed to the economic revitalization of backward areas, especially "overpopulated" areas, and to a certain extent has curbed the outflow of people, thus promoting a balanced development of the country. Although I do not think so. In addition, in terms of time, the high speed movement system can create a lot of time economic value, according to the White Paper on Transport in Japan, by 1995 the Shinkansen had created 1.7 trillion yen in pure time effect.</p>
